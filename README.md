# RPi-chromium
Chromium tools for the Raspberry Pi

## Install
You must have Chromium installed: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=121195
To install the local youtube extension, run this:
`./install`
The installer will install youtube-dl and the native script. You must install the chrome extension!

## What is this?
This is currently a git for various Chromium additions to make it run smoother on the raspberry pi, starting with the youtube local extension. It is currently in beta, but getting more stable.

## Limitations
Right now, it's bare minimum. You can't change the omxplayer options and it only works if installed in the /home/pi directory. These are actively being worked on.
